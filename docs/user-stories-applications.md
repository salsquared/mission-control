# Applications — User Stories

Working list. Priority emoji matches `docs/todo.md` (🔴 = must-have for next ship, 🟡 = important, 🔵 = nice-to-have / later).

## 1. Capture from email

1. 🔴 As a job seeker, when a recruiter emails me, I want the app to detect it automatically so I don't have to manually log every confirmation, rejection, or interview invite.
2. 🔴 As a user signing in for the first time, I want a one-click "Scan inbox" that walks the last 6 months so my pipeline isn't empty.
3. 🔴 As a user, I want re-running a scan to be safe — no duplicate applications, no duplicate timeline rows.
4. 🟡 As a user, I want clearly non-application emails (newsletters, generic marketing, ATS-promo blasts) to be filtered out before they hit the LLM classifier so I'm not paying tokens on noise.

## 2. Pipeline view

5. 🔴 As a user, I want to see all my applications as a kanban (Applied / Phone Screen / Interview / Offer / Rejected) with company, role, and last-update date.
6. 🔴 As a user, I want to drag an application between columns and have that status change persist.
7. 🔴 As a user, I want to manually add an application that didn't come from email (e.g., I applied via a portal that doesn't send confirmation).
8. 🔴 As a user, I want to click into an application and see its full timeline (every email, status change, interview, etc.) in chronological order.

## 3. Calendar integration

9. 🟡 As a user, when an interview gets scheduled (by email or by me), I want it to appear on my Google Calendar automatically with the company/role in the description.
10. 🟡 As a user, if I edit the calendar event in Google Calendar (reschedule, change notes), I want that to flow back into Mission Control.
11. 🟡 As a user, I want to link a calendar event I already made manually ("phone screen with Acme") to an application without duplicating it.
12. 🟡 As a user, I want the upcoming-events widget on the Applications dash to show only interviews & assessments — not every email-received row.

## 4. Manual edits

13. 🟡 As a user, I want to edit any field on an application (company, role, status, next steps) and have it stick.
14. 🟡 As a user, I want to add a free-form note to an application (e.g., "recruiter said decision by Friday").
15. 🟡 As a user, I want to delete an application that was misclassified or no longer relevant.

## 5. Job discovery — crawlers & watchers

16. 🔴 As a user, I want to declare watchlists of job-search criteria (role keywords, locations, seniority, remote ok, salary floor) so the app can hunt on my behalf.
17. 🔴 As a user, I want to add specific company careers pages to a watchlist (e.g., rocketlabusa.com/careers, planet.com/careers, spacex.com/careers) so I get notified the moment they post a relevant role.
18. 🟡 As a user, I want the crawler to support aggregate sources too — LinkedIn Jobs, Greenhouse-hosted boards, Lever-hosted boards, Ashby, Workday — so I don't have to maintain a list of direct URLs for every company.
19. 🔴 As a user, I want each watchlist run to produce a deduped "new postings" feed (URL, company, title, location, posted-at, raw snippet) that I can review without leaving Mission Control.
20. 🟡 As a user, I want to one-click "track" a posting from the feed and have it become a draft Application in `INTERESTED` status, with the listing URL and parsed metadata pre-filled.
21. 🟡 As a user, I want crawlers to run on a schedule (e.g., hourly for LinkedIn, every 6h for direct careers pages) and respect each source's politeness limits — no aggressive scraping that gets the IP blocked.
22. 🟡 As a user, I want the watcher to detect when a posting I've already saved gets *removed* from the source page so I know the role closed.
23. 🔵 As a user, I want to define "negative filters" (companies, technologies, or phrases like "Series A," "on-site only") that auto-hide matching postings from my feed.
24. 🔵 As a user, I want compensation parsed out of postings when present (range, equity hints, location adjustment) so I can sort by it.

## 6. Notification pipeline

25. 🔴 As a user, when the crawler finds a new posting matching a high-priority watchlist, I want a notification (in-app, browser push, optionally email) within minutes — not the next time I open the dashboard.
26. 🟡 As a user, I want a per-watchlist notification preference (e.g., "Rocket Lab — notify on anything new", "LinkedIn — daily digest only") so I'm not pinged for every fuzzy match.
27. 🟡 As a user, I want notifications for application-side events too — interview scheduled, offer received, no response in N days, decision deadline approaching — using the same delivery mechanism as the crawler.
28. 🔵 As a user, I want a "quiet hours" window so notifications don't fire while I'm asleep.

## 7. Resume & professional history

29. 🔴 As a user, I want a structured profile of my work history (roles, companies, dates, responsibilities, skills, accomplishments with metrics) stored once and reused everywhere — not retyped per resume.
30. 🔴 As a user, I want to import my profile from an existing resume (PDF / DOCX / LinkedIn export) so I don't bootstrap it by hand.
30a. 🔴 As a user, I want my profile to act as a master repository of resume material I can tailor from — not a single "current" resume. I want to upload one resume or many (over time, across roles), and have the LLM recognize duplicate items (same role, same bullet, near-identical wording across uploads) and merge them with what I've already captured, while adding any genuinely new items. Over months of applications this should *accumulate* into a richer pool, never overwrite it, so any future tailored resume can pull the strongest evidence from across my whole history.
31. 🟡 As a user, I want to edit any history entry (add a bullet, fix a date, retire a role) and have the change flow into every future generated resume.
32. 🟡 As a user, I want to tag bullets and accomplishments with skills/keywords (e.g., "Go", "distributed systems", "leadership") so I can filter and surface the right ones per role.
33. 🔵 As a user, I want versioned snapshots of my profile so I can see how my history has been described over time and roll back unintended edits.

## 8. Tailored resume generation

34. 🔴 As a user, given a job posting (URL or pasted text), I want the app to generate a tailored resume that pulls only the most relevant bullets from my profile and reorders them to match the role's emphasis.
35. 🟡 As a user, I want to see *why* each bullet was selected (which keyword in the posting it maps to) so I can sanity-check the output before sending.
36. 🟡 As a user, I want to lock specific bullets as "always include" (e.g., my current role's headline) and exclude others entirely.
37. 🟡 As a user, I want to pick a visual template/style for the generated resume (single-column, two-column, ATS-plain) and have generation respect it.
38. 🔴 As a user, I want the generated resume to be exportable as PDF and DOCX, with the same content rendered identically across both.
39. 🟡 As a user, I want every generated resume archived against the Application it was sent for so I can later say "what version did I send Acme on March 5?"
40. 🔵 As a user, I want a generated cover letter alongside the resume, with the same posting/profile context.
41. 🔵 As a user, I want a "skills gap" report — keywords the posting emphasizes that my profile lacks evidence for — so I know what to address in the cover letter or upskill on.

## 9. GitHub-driven project metrics

42. 🟡 As a user, I want to connect my GitHub account so the app can keep an updated list of my repos, languages used, stars, commit cadence, and notable PRs.
43. 🟡 As a user, I want to flag specific repos as "portfolio" so they're surfaced as project bullets on generated resumes with auto-summarized descriptions and metrics (LOC, language mix, "X commits over Y months", deploy/users if I provide them).
44. 🟡 As a user, I want the project summaries to refresh on a schedule so a resume generated today reflects last week's progress, not a stale snapshot.
45. 🔵 As a user, I want suggested portfolio-bullet rewrites when a repo's metrics meaningfully change (crossed a star threshold, shipped a new language, big release) so my resume stays sharp without me babysitting it.
46. 🔵 As a user, I want to pull READMEs into the profile as source material for bullet generation, not just commit metadata.

## 10. Application document tracking

47. 🟡 As a user, I want to attach the exact resume and cover letter I sent to each Application so the timeline shows the artifacts, not just the events.
48. 🔵 As a user, I want a diff view between two resume versions sent to different companies so I can see what I changed and why.

## 11. Follow-up & nudges

49. 🟡 As a user, I want the app to flag applications where I've had no response in N days (configurable per stage) and offer to draft a follow-up email.
50. 🔵 As a user, I want to track recruiter/hiring-manager contacts per application (name, email, last touched) so follow-ups are addressed to the right person.

## 12. Multi-kind applications

51. 🔵 As a user, I want the same pipeline to handle non-job applications — citizenship, grad school, grants, accelerators — since the schema already supports `kind`. (Decide at MVP: keep the UI job-focused but don't paint into a corner.)

## 13. Future / out of scope for now

52. 🔵 Browser extension for one-click "save this posting" from any careers page (avoids needing every site supported by the crawler).
53. 🔵 Auto-fill of application forms (Greenhouse / Workday / Lever) from the stored profile.
54. 🔵 Interview prep tracker — questions asked per company, my answers, what to brush up on.
55. 🔵 Salary research per company (Levels.fyi / public filings / glassdoor) auto-attached to applications.

## Decisions

### ✅ 1. Crawler runtime — `mission-control-scheduler` (NOT Pulsar)

Pulsar is strictly financial ingestion (crypto, stocks, FRED) and that boundary is load-bearing. Crawlers, watchers, and any non-financial recurring jobs live in the existing `mission-control-scheduler` PM2 process (`scheduler/index.ts`), which already shares the Prisma client and `prisma/prod.db` with the web tier under SQLite WAL.

Implication: new files for this work go under `scheduler/jobs/` (e.g., `scheduler/jobs/job-watcher.ts`). The web tier exposes read/write API routes; the scheduler ticks the cron and writes results into the shared DB. Mission Control is "just a frontend and interface" — it does not host the long-running crawlers in-process.

### ✅ 2. Notification delivery — in-app + email

Email is in scope; we'll need it for other notification surfaces in Mission Control anyway, so the work amortizes. SMS / push are deferred. Provider TBD when we wire it up (Resend / Postmark / nodemailer-via-Gmail are all on the table; pick when implementing).

### ✅ 3. Resume rendering — HTML → print-to-PDF (headless browser)

Templates live as React/HTML components. PDF export goes through a headless-Chromium print job (Puppeteer or Playwright). DOCX export comes later from the same templated HTML via an HTML→DOCX converter, so visual templates are defined once.

### ✅ 4. Profile schema — Option C (hybrid spine + JSON bullets)

A small set of "spine" tables for queryable structure, with bullets stored as JSON arrays on the entity that owns them. Picked over fully-normalized (A) and pure blob (B) as the right balance of selection ergonomics and schema stability for a single-user dataset.

Tables:
- `Profile` (userId, headline, summary, location, email, phone, linksJson)
- `WorkRole` (profileId, company, title, location, startDate, endDate, bulletsJson, order)
- `Project` (profileId, name, description, repoUrl, liveUrl, bulletsJson, metricsJson, order)
- `Education` (profileId, institution, degree, field, startDate, endDate, bulletsJson, order)

Each `bulletsJson` is `[{ id, text, tags: string[], locked: bool, excluded: bool }]` — bullet `id` is stable (cuid generated client- or server-side, stored inside the JSON).

Why this shape:
- **Selection (story 34)** stays SQL-ish: pull all bullets for a user (a handful of rows → a few hundred bullets total), filter by tag overlap with posting keywords in JS. LLM only rewrites the chosen bullets; it doesn't select.
- **Traceability (35) / lock / exclude (36)** all key off the stable bullet id.
- **Edit a bullet (31)** reads the owning row, mutates the JSON array, writes the row. Cheap for one user.
- **Skill tags** are denormalized strings inside each bullet — no `Skill`/`BulletSkill` join tables. Re-tagging means re-running the LLM tagger.
- **Versioning (33)** = snapshot table per spine entity (each row's prior state copied on edit), simpler than per-bullet audit rows.
- **Schema churn** stays low: adding "Publications" or "Talks" later is one new spine table, not a four-table migration.

Disfavored alternatives:
- **Option A (fully normalized)** — `Bullet`, `Skill`, `BulletSkill`, etc. Most ergonomic at query time, but 6–8 tables and the most schema-churn risk as the profile model evolves.
- **Option B (single JSON blob)** — fastest to ship but every generation pays LLM tokens to re-read the whole profile, and lock/exclude needs ids inside the blob anyway.
- **Option D (blob + denormalized BulletIndex)** — blob as canonical with a projected index. Rejected because the projection becomes the new thing that can silently drift.

### ✅ 5. GitHub access — public API only

No OAuth scope to maintain. We pull public repo metadata (commits, languages, stars, READMEs). Private repos are out of scope; if you want one represented on a resume you can add it manually as a `Project` row.

## Milestones

Tracks are independent (different code surfaces, can be sequenced or parallelized). Each milestone scopes to the 🔴 stories in its section; 🟡/🔵 stories live in a follow-up milestone of the same track.

### Track A — Pipeline UX & manual edits
Sections §2, §4, §10–12. Frontend-heavy; builds on existing `Application` + `ApplicationEvent`. Closest to user-visible value.

Current state (what already works): the Kanban view in `components/views/ApplicationsView.tsx` renders applications grouped by status across five columns (Applied / Assessment / Interviewing / Offer / Archive). `KanbanWidget` already supports drag-and-drop via an `onStatusChange` callback. The Gmail webhook + multi-kind classifier ingests new applications and writes `ApplicationEvent` rows. What's missing is *every write path from the UI* — status, manual add, edits, notes, delete — plus the per-application drill-in.

#### MA — Pipeline writes + drill-in (🔴 stories 5, 6, 7, 8)

Wires the existing Kanban to writes and adds the missing per-application detail view.

- **MA.1 — Write API.** Extend `app/api/applications/route.ts` with `POST` (manual create — story 7), `PATCH` (status + any field — story 6/13), `DELETE` (story 15, deferred until MA-followup but the schema supports it cleanly via cascade). All routes session-gated through `getServerSession` → `findUserByEmail` → ownership check on `Application.userId`. Zod schemas in a new `lib/schemas/applications.ts`. PATCH writes an `ApplicationEvent` of `kind: STATUS_CHANGED` (with `fromStatus`/`toStatus`) whenever status moves — so story 8's drill-in shows status flips alongside email events automatically.
- **MA.2 — Drag-to-status wiring (story 6).** `ApplicationsView` gets an `onStatusChange={(id, newStatus) => api.applications.update({id, status: newStatus})}` on the KanbanWidget, with optimistic update via TanStack `setQueryData` and rollback on error (mirroring the `PlanningView` pattern). Broadcast `Application.upsert` on the server side.
- **MA.3 — Manual add (story 7).** "Add application" button on the Applications dash header opens a small modal: company, role, status (default `APPLIED`), kind (`job` / `internship` / `college` / `other`), optional URL, optional date applied. POST creates the row and (if dateApplied is set) an `ApplicationEvent kind: APPLIED`. No email linkage required.
- **MA.4 — Drill-in timeline (story 8).** Click an application card → opens an overlay (`components/overlays/ApplicationDetailOverlay.tsx`) showing: header (company, role, status as editable chip, dates), timeline (every `ApplicationEvent` for this application, chronologically — `EMAIL_RECEIVED`, `STATUS_CHANGED`, `INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED`, etc., with each event's `title`/`notes`/`scheduledAt`/`occurredAt`), and a footer "Add note" composer. Pulls from the existing `/api/applications/events?applicationId=<id>` route; no new read endpoint needed.
- **MA.5 — Add-note composer (story 14, pulled forward).** The footer in MA.4 calls a new `POST /api/applications/events` with `{applicationId, kind: 'NOTE', title, notes, occurredAt: now}`. Notes are first-class timeline rows, not a separate `Application.notes` column — keeps the timeline as the only thing the user has to read to understand the application's state.
- **MA.6 — API client + types.** New `api.applications.update`, `api.applications.create`, `api.applications.delete`, `api.applications.events.create` in `lib/api-client.ts`. Zod response schemas; query key fanout: `['applications']`, `['applications', 'events', id]`.

Deferred to MA-followup (🟡): inline-edit of arbitrary fields (story 13 — most fields are already edited via status drag + note compose; remaining ones — company/role/nextSteps — get inline edit on the overlay), delete confirmation UI (story 15 — DELETE route ships in MA.1 but the button comes later), kind toggle UI on existing rows (story 51 — schema already supports `kind`, the UI just needs to surface it).

Deferred to track A's second milestone (MA-2, 🟡): document attachment (stories 47–48; ties into M8 resume archival), follow-up nudges (stories 49–50; scheduler job + UI).

### Track B — Job discovery + notifications
Sections §5, §6. Self-contained server work: new scheduler jobs, new tables, a new fetcher strategy. Per Decision 1, all crawler work runs in `mission-control-scheduler` (NOT Pulsar — that boundary is load-bearing).

Current state: `scheduler/index.ts` is a simple `setInterval` runner with one job (`cache-prune`). `lib/fetchers/` has four strategies (rss, scrape, snapi, google-news) used by the company news pipeline. None of the watchlist / posting / notification schema exists yet.

#### MB — Watchlists, crawler, in-app notifications (🔴 stories 16, 17, 19, 25)

Ships a working "hunt on my behalf" loop end-to-end at minimum viable scope: declare a careers-page watchlist, scheduler crawls it, new postings deduplicate into a feed, a notification fires in-app.

- **MB.1 — Schema.** Three new tables:
  - `Watchlist` (id, userId, name, kind: `'careers-page' | 'keyword'`, config JSON, scheduleMinutes Int, lastRunAt DateTime?, lastSuccessAt DateTime?, lastError String?, active Boolean default true). For `careers-page` the config is `{ rootUrl, listingSelector, titleSelector, linkSelector, locationSelector?, postedAtSelector?, snippetSelector? }`. For `keyword` (deferred): `{ source, query, filters }`.
  - `JobPosting` (id, watchlistId, externalId String — stable hash of company+title+link when no native id, company, title, location, postedAt?, snippet?, sourceUrl, status: `'new' | 'tracked' | 'hidden' | 'closed'`, firstSeenAt, lastSeenAt, removedAt?, raw JSON). `@@unique([watchlistId, externalId])` for dedup.
  - `Notification` (id, userId, kind: `'posting' | 'application' | 'system'`, title, body, payload JSON, channels: `'in_app,email'`, createdAt, readAt?, dismissedAt?). Index `[userId, createdAt]`.

  Migration name: `add_watchlists_postings_notifications`. Add `User.watchlists`, `User.notifications` relations.

- **MB.2 — Generic careers-page fetcher.** New `lib/fetchers/careers-page-fetcher.ts`: given the `careers-page` config, fetch the root URL with a politeness-respecting client (single concurrent request per host, 2s min delay between requests to the same host, User-Agent identifying the bot), parse with cheerio, run the configured selectors, return `RawPosting[]`. Reused by the scheduler job — never called from web tier. Errors are reported but don't throw (writes `lastError` on the Watchlist).

- **MB.3 — Scheduler job.** New `scheduler/jobs/job-watcher.ts` exporting `runJobWatcher()`. Registered in `scheduler/index.ts` JOBS array, runs every 10 minutes. Algorithm per tick:
  1. Load all `Watchlist` rows where `active = true` and `lastRunAt < now - scheduleMinutes`.
  2. For each watchlist, fetch via the configured strategy (`careers-page` for MB).
  3. Compute `externalId` per posting (hash of company+title+link).
  4. Upsert into `JobPosting`: new rows → `status: 'new'` + create a `Notification` row (kind: 'posting'); existing rows → bump `lastSeenAt`. Any prior posting *not* in the current fetch result for this watchlist → set `removedAt` and `status: 'closed'` (story 22's groundwork — schema-side support, no UI yet).
  5. Update Watchlist `lastRunAt`/`lastSuccessAt`/`lastError`.

- **MB.4 — Read/write API.**
  - `app/api/watchlists/route.ts` (GET list, POST create) + `[id]/route.ts` (PATCH update, DELETE). Session-gated.
  - `app/api/postings/route.ts` (GET feed; query params: `?status=new&watchlistId=...&limit=50`).
  - `app/api/postings/[id]/route.ts` (PATCH to set status; `tracked` is the one-click "track" from story 20 — pulled forward enough to wire to a future MB-followup "create Application from posting" flow, but no Application creation yet in MB).
  - `app/api/notifications/route.ts` (GET list, PATCH mark-read/mark-all-read). Notifications stream in via SSE using the existing `lib/events.ts` (`Notification.upsert` events).

- **MB.5 — In-app notification surface.** A new corner widget (bell icon in the dash header? or a slide-in overlay? — decide on implementation): unread count badge, dropdown lists recent notifications, click navigates to the posting in the feed. New `lib/api-client.ts` keys: `api.watchlists`, `api.postings`, `api.notifications`. SSE listener via `useServerEvents('Notification', invalidate)`.

- **MB.6 — Watchlists & feed view.** New section in the Applications dash (or a new dedicated "Discovery" dash, TBD when wiring): "Watchlists" card lists active watchlists with last-run status + edit/pause; "New postings" card lists `JobPosting` rows with `status: 'new'`, each with a "Track" / "Hide" button. Editing a watchlist's selectors is a form with inputs for each CSS selector + a "Test" button that runs the fetcher in-process and shows what got parsed (helps the user dial in selectors without waiting for the next scheduler tick).

Deferred to MB-followup (🟡 stories 18, 20, 21, 22, 26, 27):
- **Aggregator strategies** (story 18) — Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday each have a stable API or a stable HTML shape. One fetcher per source (`greenhouse-fetcher.ts`, etc.) reusing the politeness layer from MB.2.
- **LinkedIn** (story 21's hourly cadence + politeness-sensitive source) — separate, slowest cadence and most-likely-to-get-blocked; needs careful UA + rate strategy.
- **"Track" → draft Application** (story 20) — wires `POST /api/postings/[id]/track` to create an `Application` with `status: 'INTERESTED'` (new status value to add to the enum-by-convention) prefilled from the posting metadata.
- **Closed-posting UI** (story 22) — the schema already records `removedAt`; surface it as a "Closed" filter in the feed and a status badge on tracked postings.
- **Per-watchlist notification preferences** (story 26) — add `notificationMode: 'each' | 'digest'` to Watchlist, and a daily digest job that batches `each: false` watchlists.
- **Application-side notifications** (story 27) — reuse `Notification` table, fire on `ApplicationEvent` create when kind is one of (`INTERVIEW_SCHEDULED`, `OFFER`, `REJECTION`); a separate "no response in N days" scheduler job.
- **Email delivery** (Decision 2) — once a provider is picked, the notification dispatcher reads `channels` and sends via the provider. The scheduler job that fires notifications doesn't need to change.

Deferred to 🔵 round: negative filters (story 23), compensation parsing (story 24), quiet hours (story 28).

### Track C — Profile + resume + GitHub
Sections §7, §8, §9. Unblocked by Decision 4 (Option C). Largest new surface area.

#### M7 — Profile spine + import (🔴 stories 29, 30)

Ships a structured profile model and a way to import an existing resume into it. No resume generation yet (that's M8).

- **M7.1 — Schema.** Add `Profile`, `WorkRole`, `Project`, `Education` to `prisma/schema.prisma`. `WorkRole.bullets` / `Project.bullets` / `Education.bullets` are JSON columns shaped `[{id, text, tags[], locked, excluded}]`. `Project.metrics` JSON column reserved for §9 GitHub job. Migration name `add_profile_spine`. Run against `dev.db`; run separately against `prod.db`.
- **M7.2 — Read/write API.** `app/api/profile/route.ts` (`GET` upserts an empty profile on first call; `PATCH` for header fields). Child routes `app/api/profile/work-roles/route.ts` + `[id]/route.ts`, mirrored for `projects` and `education`. Bullet array writes go through helpers in `lib/profile/bullets.ts`. All routes scope by `userId` from `getServerSession`. No `withCache` — these are user-write paths.
- **M7.3 — `ProfileView` dash.** New dash registered in `BASE_DASHES`, default title + hue in the store, `components/views/ProfileView.tsx`. Sections: Header card (inline-edit identity), Work history (stack of `WorkRoleCard`s with drag-reorder + add-role), Projects (same shape), Education (same shape). Bullets render as `BulletRow`s with lock/exclude toggles. Tag chips read-only this milestone.
- **M7.4 — Import (merge, not overwrite — per story 30a).** `POST /api/profile/import` accepts PDF (`pdf-parse`), DOCX (`mammoth`), LinkedIn export ZIP (unzip → `Positions.csv` / `Education.csv` / `Projects.csv`), or pasted text JSON. Accepts **one or many** files in a single upload. Pipeline:
  1. Extract raw text per file.
  2. LLM structured-output pass per file → `{workRoles[], projects[], education[]}` candidate tree.
  3. **Dedupe + merge** against existing profile:
     - Work role match key: `(company, title)` with a date-overlap tiebreaker. On match, merge bullet arrays by LLM-judged semantic similarity (drop near-duplicate wording, keep the strongest phrasing); on no match, create a new role.
     - Project match key: `name` (case-insensitive) with `repoUrl` tiebreaker.
     - Education match key: `(institution, degree, field)`.
     - Bullet match: an LLM "are these two bullets the same accomplishment?" gate keyed on stable bullet ids, run only against bullets in the same parent entity.
  4. Single Prisma transaction writes the merged result.
  UI is a modal from the ProfileView header: drag-drop one or many files, a preview pane showing per-file "new vs merged vs duplicate" counts, and an explicit "Append to repository" CTA (no destructive overwrite — the master-repository framing in story 30a forbids it). A "Reset profile" button stays available as a separate path with its own confirmation.
- **M7.5 — Wiring.** `User.profile` relation; TanStack query keys `['profile']` etc.; invalidate the right keys per mutation; let `ProfileView` own its fetching (no preload from `Dashboard`).

Deferred to M7-followup (🟡): tag editing UI on bullets (story 32 — `tags[]` is already in the shape), inline tag autocomplete, profile snapshots/versioning (story 33; `ProfileSnapshot(userId, takenAt, payloadJson)`, button-press-only).

Out of scope (handled in later milestones): resume HTML→PDF rendering (M8), GitHub-driven project metrics (M9 writes to `Project.metrics`).

#### M8 — Tailored resume generation (current focus)

🔴 stories 34, 38. Ships a working "paste posting → get tailored PDF" loop end-to-end at minimum viable scope. Builds on M7's Profile spine — depends on the stable bullet ids and the `tags[]` / `locked` / `excluded` flags already in the bullet JSON shape (Decision 4).

Phase 1 ships the PDF; DOCX, archival, multi-template, cover letter, and skills-gap are deferred phases.

**Phase 1 — PDF MVP**

- **M8.1 — Dependencies.** Add `@google/genai` (Google's unified GenAI SDK; supports Gemini API key flow on the free tier) and `puppeteer-core` (no bundled Chromium — points at the system Chrome at `/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome`, verified present as Chrome 148.x on this machine). Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to the untracked `.env` and document it in CLAUDE.md alongside the other secrets. Free-tier Gemini keys come from Google AI Studio (aistudio.google.com).
- **M8.2 — Gemini client wrapper.** New `lib/ai/gemini.ts` exposes `chatJSON<T>({system, user, schema, model?})` where `schema` is a Zod schema validated against the parsed response. Defaults to `gemini-2.0-flash` (free-tier friendly, fast, sufficient for bullet rewriting). Uses `@google/genai`'s `generateContent` with `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` for structured output, wraps retries (429 / 5xx), and surfaces a typed `AIError` on schema failure (so callers can show "couldn't parse posting" rather than a stack trace). All M8 prompts route through this — never construct the SDK inline. Log token usage to `console.info` so the in-app log viewer captures it.
- **M8.3 — Posting parser.** `lib/resumes/posting.ts` exports `parsePosting(input: {url?: string, text?: string}): Promise<ParsedPosting>` where `ParsedPosting = {title?, company?, location?, seniority?, rawText: string, keywords: string[]}`. URL inputs fetch the page, strip with cheerio, and feed the visible text. Keyword extraction is one Claude call: "Return the 10–25 most load-bearing terms from this posting — technologies, methodologies, seniority signals, domain words. JSON array of strings." Cached via `withCache(..., 60 * 60)` keyed on the URL or a hash of the pasted text, so re-generating against the same posting is free.
- **M8.4 — Bullet selection (deterministic).** `lib/resumes/select.ts` exports `selectBullets(profile, keywords): Selection[]`. For each bullet across work roles / projects / education:
  - **Score** = `2 × (tag-overlap count)` + `1 × (case-insensitive substring matches of any keyword inside the bullet text)`.
  - `locked: true` → score is `+Infinity` (always included).
  - `excluded: true` → bullet is skipped entirely.
  - Sort each entity's bullets by score desc; take top N per entity (defaults: work role 4, project 3, education 2). Drop entities whose entire bullet set scored 0 unless the entity is locked at the entity level (a future flag — for now, always include education and the most-recent work role even with zero matches).
  - Output `Selection[]`: `{kind: 'workRole'|'project'|'education', sourceId, bulletId, originalText, score, matchedTags[], matchedKeywords[]}`.
  - Pure / deterministic / no LLM. Easy to unit-test as `scripts/tests/resume-select-smoke.ts`.
- **M8.5 — Bullet rewrite (LLM).** `lib/resumes/rewrite.ts` exports `rewriteBullets(selections, posting): Promise<RewrittenBullet[]>`. Single Claude call. The prompt:
  - Includes the full `Selection[]` plus the posting's keywords + title/company/seniority.
  - Constraints: "lead with strong action verbs; do NOT invent metrics or claims absent from the original; match the posting's terminology where the concept already matches; keep each bullet to ~1 line / ≤ 25 words; preserve the bullet `id` exactly."
  - Returns `[{id, rewrittenText, matchedKeywords[]}]`. Validated by Zod; if any returned id doesn't match an input id, fail loudly.
  - Single call, not per-bullet — keeps token cost predictable (a profile of ~30 bullets stays well inside Sonnet's context).
- **M8.6 — Template + PDF render.** `lib/resumes/templates/ats-plain.tsx` is a server-only React component with no client JS: header (name, headline, links), Experience (work roles with rewritten bullets), Projects, Education. Styling is plain CSS-in-string or a single `<style>` tag in the rendered HTML (no Tailwind in the rendered page — keep the surface minimal for ATS parsers). `lib/resumes/render-pdf.ts` exports `renderResumePDF(props): Promise<Buffer>`:
  - `import { renderToStaticMarkup } from 'react-dom/server'` → wrap in `<!doctype html><html>…</html>` boilerplate.
  - Launch puppeteer with `{ headless: 'new' }`, `await page.setContent(html, { waitUntil: 'networkidle0' })`, `return page.pdf({ format: 'Letter', printBackground: false, margin: { top: '0.5in', bottom: '0.5in', left: '0.5in', right: '0.5in' } })`.
  - Browser is **pooled on `globalThis`** to survive HMR and avoid paying the ~1s launch cost per request. Single shared browser, multiple pages per request.
- **M8.7 — API endpoint + trigger UI.** `app/api/resumes/route.ts`:
  - `POST` → body `{posting: {url?, text?}, options?: {template?: 'ats-plain'}}`. Session-gated through `requireSession`. Runs `parsePosting → selectBullets → rewriteBullets → renderResumePDF`. Streams back `application/pdf` with `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="resume-<company>-<date>.pdf"`.
  - Errors return JSON `{error, stage}` (where `stage` is one of `parse | select | rewrite | render`) so the UI can show a useful failure message.
  - Trigger UI: new `components/cards/GenerateResumeCard.tsx` on the Profile dash. Inputs: URL field + textarea (paste posting). "Generate" button hits the endpoint via `fetch` (NOT TanStack mutation — we want the raw PDF blob). On success, `window.open(URL.createObjectURL(blob))` opens it in a new tab; user can save from there. Don't try to embed an `<iframe>` PDF preview in v1.
  - `api.resumes.generate(...)` helper in `lib/api-client.ts` returning `Promise<Blob>`.

**Phase 1 acceptance criteria:**
- A profile with ≥ 3 work roles and ≥ 3 bullets each produces a one-page PDF in ≤ 15 seconds against a real Greenhouse-hosted posting.
- The PDF opens in Chrome/Preview/Acrobat with no rendering glitches.
- Locked bullets always appear; excluded bullets never appear.
- A bullet's text in the PDF differs from the source bullet only in phrasing — no hallucinated metrics, no fabricated claims.

**Phase 2 — archival + traceability**

- **M8.8 — `GeneratedResume` schema.** New table: `(id, userId, createdAt, postingInput JSON, profileSnapshot JSON, selections JSON, rewrites JSON, templateKey, status enum, pdfPath String?, applicationId String?)`. Each generation gets persisted *after* the PDF renders successfully. `profileSnapshot` is the full hydrated profile at gen-time so future profile edits don't break the archive. `pdfPath` points at `data/resumes/<id>.pdf` (gitignored).
- **M8.9 — Traceability UI (story 35).** A "Why this bullet?" toggle on the trigger UI shows, per selection, the matched keywords + matched tags + score. Reads from the `selections` payload of the last generation.
- **M8.10 — Per-Application linkage (story 39).** Once MA ships the application detail overlay, `applicationId` on `GeneratedResume` lets the timeline show "Resume vN sent on 2026-XX-XX".

**Phase 3 — DOCX (story 38's second half)**

- **M8.11 — DOCX export.** Add `html-to-docx` (or equivalent — evaluate at implementation time). Same templated HTML feeds the converter; `?format=docx` on the API switches the response. Decision 3 explicitly puts this after PDF.

**Deferred to M8-followup (🟡):**
- Multiple templates (story 37) — single-column, two-column, modern, etc. Picker on the trigger UI.
- Lock / exclude UI for bullets (story 36) — schema already supports it via the M7 `BulletRow` toggles, just needs to be exposed prominently.

**Deferred to 🔵 round:**
- Cover letter generation (story 40) — same scaffolding, different prompt + template.
- Skills-gap report (story 41) — posting keywords minus the union of bullet tags + bullet substrings.

#### M9 — GitHub-driven project metrics (later)
🟡 stories 42–43. New scheduler job under `scheduler/jobs/` that hits the public GitHub API for the user's portfolio-flagged `Project` rows and writes into `Project.metrics`. Detailed plan when M7 ships.
